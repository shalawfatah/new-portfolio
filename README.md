# Protfolio Website
This is a portfolio website created as a presentation.
I've built several profiles throughout yearrs, using different technologies, mainly React, Next, Gatsby, Astro, and this one utilises Svelte.
I've got to say I liked using Svelte more than any other framework/library I've ever used. I think most irritating issues have been solved in Svelte.
It's insanely good.
